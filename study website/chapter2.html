            <h2>Chapter 2: Acids, Bases and Salts</h2>
            <p class="chapter-tagline">Exploring the fundamental chemical properties of common substances around us.</p>
            <p>From the <span class="highlight">sour taste of lemon</span> to the <span class="highlight">slippery feel of soap</span>, acids, bases, and salts play a crucial role in our daily lives and in countless chemical processes. In this chapter, we will delve into their definitions, properties, reactions, and significance, unraveling the chemistry behind their unique behaviors.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="concept-section">
            <h3>2.1 Understanding Acids and Bases: The Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>Acids and bases are two fundamental classes of chemical compounds with distinct properties that impact everything from our food to industrial processes. We identify them through their chemical behavior rather than taste or touch, as many are corrosive.</p>

            <h4>2.1.1 Acids: The Producers of H<sup>+</sup> Ions</h4>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>What are Acids?</h4>
                <p>Acids are substances that typically taste <span class="highlight">sour</span> (though tasting strong acids is dangerous and should be avoided), turn <span class="highlight">blue litmus paper red</span>, and can neutralize bases. According to the Arrhenius theory, acids produce <span class="highlight">hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>)</span> or, more accurately, <span class="highlight">hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>)</span> when dissolved in water. It's the presence of these H<sup>+</sup> ions that gives acids their characteristic properties.</p>
                <p><strong>Common Examples of Acids:</strong> Hydrochloric acid (HCl), Sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), Nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), Acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), Carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>).</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Key Properties of Acids:</h4>
            <ul class="list-indent">
                <li><span class="highlight">Taste:</span> Sour (e.g., lemon juice, vinegar). *Always remember: Never taste chemicals in the lab!*</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Litmus Test:</span> They turn blue litmus paper red.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Corrosive Nature:</span> Strong acids are highly corrosive and can cause severe burns on skin and damage materials.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Electrical Conductivity:</span> Aqueous solutions of acids conduct electricity due to the presence of free ions.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Effect on Indicators:</span> Turn methyl orange red and phenolphthalein colorless.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2.1.2 Bases: The Producers of OH<sup>-</sup> Ions</h4>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>What are Bases?</h4>
                <p>Bases are substances that taste <span class="highlight">bitter</span> (again, do not taste them in the lab), feel <span class="highlight">slippery or soapy</span> to touch, and turn red litmus blue. According to the Arrhenius theory, bases produce <span class="highlight">hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>)</span> when dissolved in water.</p>
                <p>Those bases which are soluble in water are called <span class="highlight">alkalis</span> (e.g., NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>). All alkalis are bases, but not all bases are alkalis.</p>
                <p><strong>Common Examples of Bases:</strong> Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Potassium hydroxide (KOH), Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>), Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> - Milk of Magnesia), Ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH).</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Key Properties of Bases:</h4>
            <ul class="list-indent">
                <li><span class="highlight">Taste:</span> Bitter. *Never taste chemicals!*</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Feel:</span> Soapy or slippery to touch.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Litmus Test:</span> They turn red litmus paper blue.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Corrosive Nature:</span> Strong bases are also corrosive and can cause chemical burns.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Electrical Conductivity:</span> Aqueous solutions of bases conduct electricity.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="activity-box">
                <h4>Activity 2.3: </h4>
                <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To demonstrate that aqueous solutions of acids and bases conduct electricity, while certain other solutions (like glucose or alcohol) do not.</p>
                <p><strong>Materials Required:</strong> Beaker (100 mL), 6V battery, wires, bulb (6V), switch, two graphite rods (or carbon electrodes from old dry cells), rubber cork, dilute HCl solution, dilute NaOH solution, glucose solution, alcohol solution, distilled water.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a 100 mL beaker and place two graphite rods on a rubber cork. Connect the rods to the two terminals of a 6V battery through a switch and a bulb, as shown in the diagram.</li>
                    <li>Pour dilute HCl solution into the beaker, ensuring the electrodes are immersed.</li>
                    <li>Switch on the current and observe if the bulb glows.</li>
                    <li>Wash the beaker and electrodes thoroughly with distilled water.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the experiment with dilute NaOH solution.</li>
                    <li>Finally, repeat the experiment with glucose solution, alcohol solution, and distilled water (using a clean beaker and electrodes each time).</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The bulb <span class="highlight">glows brightly</span> when dilute HCl solution is used.</li>
                    <li>The bulb also <span class="highlight">glows brightly</span> when dilute NaOH solution is used.</li>
                    <li>The bulb <span class="highlight">does not glow</span> when glucose solution, alcohol solution, or distilled water is used.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Inference:</strong></p>
                <p>The glowing of the bulb indicates that the solutions conduct electricity. Acids (like HCl) and bases (like NaOH) dissociate into free moving ions (H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> respectively) when dissolved in water. These free ions are the charge carriers responsible for the conduction of electricity. Glucose and alcohol are covalent compounds and do not produce ions in water, hence they do not conduct electricity. Distilled water, being pure, has very few ions and is also a poor conductor. This proves that the presence of ions is crucial for electrical conductivity in aqueous solutions of acids and bases.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Chemical Reactions of Acids and Bases</h3>
            <p>Understanding how acids and bases react with other substances is key to their classification and applications.</p>

            <h4>2.2.1 Reaction of Acids with Metals: Hydrogen Gas Evolution</h4>
            <p>Acids react with most metals (that are more reactive than hydrogen in the activity series) to produce a <span class="highlight">salt</span> and <span class="highlight">hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>)</span>. This reaction is often vigorous and can be identified by the characteristic "pop" sound test for hydrogen gas when a burning splinter is brought near the gas.</p>

            <div class="activity-box">
                <h4>Activity 2.9: Reaction of Zinc with Acid and Test for Hydrogen Gas</h4>
                <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To observe the reaction of a dilute acid with a metal and identify the gas produced.</p>
                <p><strong>Materials Required:</strong> Conical flask, test tube, delivery tube, stand, dilute sulphuric acid (or dilute HCl), zinc granules, soap solution, burning splinter (candle or matchstick).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take a few zinc granules (~2-3 grams) in a clean conical flask.</li>
                    <li>Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram.</li>
                    <li>Add about 5 mL of dilute sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) to the zinc granules in the flask.</li>
                    <li>You will immediately observe the formation of gas bubbles on the surface of the zinc granules.</li>
                    <li>Pass the gas evolved through a soap solution by connecting a delivery tube from the conical flask to a test tube containing soap solution.</li>
                    <li>Bubbles of the gas will be formed in the soap solution. Bring a burning splinter near the gas-filled bubbles collected at the mouth of the test tube.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a vigorous effervescence (formation of gas bubbles) in the conical flask.</li>
                    <li>The gas produced forms bubbles in the soap solution, and these bubbles rise into the air.</li>
                    <li>When a burning splinter is brought near the gas bubbles, it extinguishes with a distinctive <span class="highlight">"pop" sound</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Inference:</strong></p>
                <p>The "pop" sound confirms that the gas produced is hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>), as hydrogen gas burns with a pop sound. This activity demonstrates that acids react with active metals (like zinc) to liberate hydrogen gas and form a salt (zinc sulphate in this case).</p>

            <h3>2.4 Neutralization Reaction: The Acid-Base Dance</h3>
            <p>The reaction between an acid and a base is called a <span class="highlight">neutralization reaction</span>. In this process, the characteristic properties of both the acid and the base are effectively "neutralized," leading to the formation of a <span class="highlight">salt</span> and <span class="highlight">water</span>. This is a specific type of double displacement reaction, specifically an acid-base reaction.</p>

            <h3>2.5 Strength of Acids and Bases: The pH Scale</h3>
            <p>Not all acids and bases are equally strong. Their strength is measured using the <span class="highlight">pH scale</span>, which indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. A higher concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions signifies a stronger acid, and a lower concentration means a stronger base.</p>
            <div class="concept-box">
                <h4>What is pH?</h4>
                <p>The term <span class="highlight">pH</span> stands for 'potential of hydrogen'. It is a logarithmic scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution, ranging from 0 to 14. The pH value is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration: <span class="highlight">pH = -log[H<sup>+</sup>]</span>.</p>
                <ul class="list-indent">
                    <li><span class="highlight">pH < 7:</span> Acidic solution (lower pH = stronger acid, higher H<sup>+</sup> concentration)</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">pH = 7:</span> Neutral solution (e.g., pure water, equal H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> concentrations)</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">pH > 7:</span> Basic (Alkaline) solution (higher pH = stronger base, lower H<sup>+</sup> concentration, higher OH<sup>-</sup> concentration)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>pH is inversely proportional to the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>). A change of one pH unit means a tenfold change in H<sup>+</sup> concentration.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Importance of pH in Everyday Life:</h4>
            <ul class="list-indent">
                <li><span class="highlight">1. Our Digestive System:</span> Our stomach produces highly acidic hydrochloric acid (pH approx. 1.2-3.0) for the digestion of food. An imbalance can lead to acidity or indigestion, which is relieved by antacids (mild bases).</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">2. pH of Soil:</span> Plants grow best at a specific pH range (usually slightly acidic to neutral). Farmers often test soil pH and adjust it by adding substances like quicklime (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) to acidic soil, or organic matter to basic soil.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">3. pH in Tooth Decay:</span> Tooth enamel, made of calcium phosphate (the hardest substance in the body), is corroded when the pH in the mouth falls below 5.5. This happens due to acids produced by bacteria breaking down sugar particles from food. Using basic toothpaste can neutralize these acids.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">4. Self-Defense by Animals and Plants:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <span class="highlight">bee sting</span> injects an acidic liquid (methanoic acid), causing pain and irritation. It can be relieved by applying a mild base like baking soda solution.</li>
                        <li>A <span class="highlight">wasp sting</span> is alkaline. It can be relieved by applying a mild acid like vinegar.</li>
                        <li>Nettle leaves have stinging hairs that inject <span class="highlight">methanoic acid</span> (formic acid), causing a burning sensation. Rubbing a dock leaf on the affected area, which contains a base, can provide relief.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="highlight">5. pH of Rain Water (Acid Rain):</span> When the pH of rainwater is below 5.6, it is called acid rain. Acid rain is caused by acidic gases (like SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>) dissolving in rainwater. It is harmful to aquatic life, damages historical monuments (e.g., Taj Mahal), and affects agricultural fields and forests.</li>

                        <li>Dilute Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) solution</li>
                        <li>Lemon juice</li>
                        <li>Aerated soft drink</li>
                        <li>Tap water</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take small amounts of each solution in separate clean test tubes or in separate depressions of a spot plate.</li>
                    <li>Add 2-3 drops of universal indicator solution to each, or dip a strip of universal indicator paper into each solution.</li>
                    <li>Observe the color change that occurs in each solution.</li>
                    <li>Compare the observed color with the standard pH colour chart provided with the universal indicator paper/solution.</li>
                    <li>Record your observations and corresponding approximate pH values.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Observations (Expected Results):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dilute HCl:</strong> Red (pH 1-2, Strongly Acidic)</li>
                    <li><strong>Lemon juice:</strong> Orange (pH 2-3, Acidic)</li>
                    <li><strong>Aerated Soft Drink:</strong> Orange-Yellow (pH 3-4, Acidic)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tap Water:</strong> Greenish-Yellow (pH 6-7, Slightly Acidic to Neutral)</li>
                    <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Light Green (pH 6.5-6.7, Slightly Acidic)</li>
                    <li><strong>Dilute Sodium Bicarbonate:</strong> Bluish-Green (pH 8-9, Weakly Basic)</li>
                    <li><strong>Toothpaste Solution:</strong> Blue (pH 9-10, Basic)</li>
                    <li><strong>Dilute NaOH:</strong> Violet (pH 13-14, Strongly Basic)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Inference:</strong></p>
                <p>This activity clearly demonstrates that different substances have a wide range of pH values. The universal indicator provides a visual means to estimate the pH, allowing us to classify solutions as strongly acidic, weakly acidic, neutral, weakly basic, or strongly basic. It reinforces the concept that the pH scale is a crucial tool for quantifying the strength of acids and bases in solutions.</p>

            <h3>2.6 Salts: The Products of Neutralization and Beyond</h3>
            <p>Salts are ionic compounds formed when an acid reacts with a base in a neutralization reaction. They consist of a cation (positive ion) from a base and an anion (negative ion) from an acid. Salts can be acidic, basic, or neutral depending on the strength of the acid and base from which they are formed.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples of Salts:</strong> Sodium chloride (NaCl), Potassium sulphate (K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), Calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>), Ammonium nitrate (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>), Sodium acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COONa).</p>

            <h4>2.6.1 Families of Salts</h4>
            <p>Salts can be categorized into families based on the common acid or base they are derived from (e.g., <span class="highlight">Chloride salts</span> are derived from hydrochloric acid, <span class="highlight">Sulphate salts</span> from sulphuric acid, <span class="highlight">Sodium salts</span> from sodium hydroxide, etc.).</p>
