                <p class="chapter-tagline">Understanding the distribution of power in democracies and why it is desirable.</p>
                <p>This chapter deals with the concept of power sharing, its importance, and different forms of power sharing in a democracy. It highlights how power sharing helps in reducing the possibility of social conflict and ensuring the stability of political order.</p>

                    <h3>Introduction to Power Sharing</h3>
                    <p>In a democracy, all power does not rest with one organ of the government. An intelligent sharing of power among .legislature., .executive., and .judiciary. is very important for the design of a democracy.</p>
                    <p>Power sharing is the distribution of power among different organs of government, different levels of government, different social groups, and different political parties, pressure groups and movements.</p>

                    <h3>Case Study 1: Belgium - The Accommodation Model</h3>
                    <p>Belgium is a small country in Europe, smaller in area than the Indian state of Haryana. It has a population of a little over one crore, about half the population of Haryana. The ethnic composition of this small country is very complex:</p>

                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>.. Demographics:</strong.>
                            <ul>
                                <li>59% live in the .Flemish region. and speak .Dutch..</li>
                                <li>40% live in the .Wallonia region. and speak .French..</li>
                                <li>Remaining 1% speak .German..</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>.Capital City (Brussels):.
                            <ul>
                                <li>In the capital city of .Brussels., the composition is strikingly different: 80% are French-speaking, while 20% are Dutch-speaking.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>.Tensions:. The minority French-speaking community was relatively rich and powerful, which led to resentment among the Dutch-speaking community. This caused tensions between the two groups during the 1950s and 1960s, especially in Brussels.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Belgian Accommodation Model (1970-1993):</h4>
                    <p>Recognizing the existence of regional differences and cultural diversities, the Belgian leaders chose a path of accommodation. They amended their Constitution four times between 1970 and 1993 to work out an arrangement that would enable everyone to live together within the same country. Key elements of their model include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>.Equal Representation in Central Government:. The .Belgian Constitution. prescribes that the number of .Dutch. and .French-speaking ministers. shall be equal in the .Central Government.. Some special laws require the support of the majority of members from each linguistic group. Thus, no single community can make decisions unilaterally.</li>
                        <li>.Decentralization to State Governments:. Many powers of the Central Government have been given to .State Governments. of the two regions of the country. Importantly, the .State Governments. are .not subordinate. to the .Central Government..</li>
                        <li>.Separate Government for Brussels:. .Brussels., as the capital, has a .separate government. in which both communities (French and Dutch speakers) have .equal representation.. This was a crucial compromise, as French speakers accepted equal representation in Brussels even though they were a majority there, and Dutch speakers accepted it in the Central Government despite being a majority in the country.</li>
                        <li>.Community Government:. A unique feature is the .Community Government.. This third kind of government is elected by people belonging to one language community – .Dutch., .French., and .German-speaking. – no matter where they live. This government has the power regarding .cultural., .educational., and .language-related issues..</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="highlight">The Belgian model successfully managed ethnic diversity through power sharing, avoiding civil strife and a potential division of the country on linguistic lines. This stability eventually allowed Brussels to become the headquarters of the European Union.</p>

                    <h3>Case Study 2: Sri Lanka - Majoritarianism</h3>
                    <p>Sri Lanka is an island nation, just a few kilometres off the southern coast of Tamil Nadu. It has a diverse population of about two crore people. The major social groups are the .Sinhala speakers. (74%) and the .Tamil speakers. (18%).</p>

                        </div>
                        <ul>
                        <li>.Tamil Sub-groups:.
                            <ul>
                                <li>.Sri Lankan Tamils. (13%): Native to the country.</li>
                                <li>.Indian Tamils.: Whose forefathers came from India as plantation workers during the colonial period.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>.Religious Demographics:. Most of the Sinhala-speaking people are .Buddhists.. Most of the Tamils are .Hindus. or .Muslims.. There are about 7% Christians, who are both Tamil and Sinhala.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>The Majoritarian Policy in Sri Lanka:</h4>
                    <p>Being in majority, the leaders of the Sinhala community sought to secure dominance over government by virtue of their majority. They adopted a series of .majoritarian measures. to establish Sinhala supremacy, rejecting power sharing with the Tamil minority. These measures included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Official Language (1956): In 1956, an Act was passed to recognise .Sinhala as the only official language., completely disregarding Tamil.</li>
                        <li>Preferential Policies: The governments followed .preferential policies. that favoured Sinhala applicants for .university positions. and .government jobs.. This openly discriminated against Tamils.</li>
                        <li>State Religion: A new Constitution stipulated that the state shall .protect and foster Buddhism., further alienating non-Buddhist communities.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Consequences of Majoritarianism:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alienation of Tamils: These measures, taken one after the other, gradually increased the feeling of alienation among the .Sri Lankan Tamils.. They felt that none of the major political parties led by the Buddhist Sinhala leaders were sensitive to their language and culture.</li>
                        <li>Discrimination: They felt that the Constitution and government policies denied them equal .political rights., discriminated against them in getting .jobs and opportunities., and ignored their .interests..</li>
                        <li>Formation of Organizations: As a result, .Sri Lankan Tamils. launched parties and struggles for the recognition of Tamil as an official language, for regional autonomy, and equality of opportunity in securing education and jobs. Their demands were repeatedly denied.</li>
                        <li>Civil War: The distrust between the two communities turned into widespread conflict. It soon escalated into a .Civil War.. As a result, thousands of people of both communities were killed, and many families were forced to leave the country as refugees, causing a terrible setback to the social, cultural, and economic life of the country.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="highlight">The Sri Lankan case shows that majoritarianism, while seemingly efficient in the short run, can undermine national unity and lead to severe conflict when power is not shared.</p>

                    <h4>Activity: Compare and Contrast</h4>
                    <p>Based on the case studies of Belgium and Sri Lanka, identify two key differences in their approaches to power sharing and the resulting outcomes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Approach to Diversity: How did each country deal with its diverse linguistic/ethnic groups?</li>
                        <li>Outcome: What was the final result for each country (peace, civil war, stability)?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Think about which model proves more effective in maintaining national unity.</p>

                    <h3>Why Power Sharing is Desirable?</h3>
                    <p>Power sharing is desirable for two main sets of reasons, which can be distinguished as Prudential and Moral.</p>

                    <h4>1. Prudential Reasons</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduces Conflict: Power sharing helps to reduce the possibility of conflict between social groups. Since social conflict often leads to violence and political instability, power sharing is a good way to ensure the stability of political order.</li>
                        <li>Prevents Tyranny: Imposing the will of the majority community over others may look like an attractive option in the short run, but in the long run, it undermines the unity of the nation. Tyranny of the majority is not just oppressive for the minority; it often brings ruin to the majority as well.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Moral Reasons</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spirit of Democrac: Power sharing is the very spirit of democracy. A truly democratic rule involves sharing power with those affected by its exercise, and who have to live with its effects.</li>
                        <li>Legitimate Government: A legitimate government is one where citizens, through participation, acquire a stake in the system. They have a say in how they are governed.</li>
                        <li><span class="highlight">Moral reasons emphasise the inherent value of power sharing.</span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Forms of Power Sharing</h3>
                    <p>The idea of power sharing has emerged in opposition to the notions of undivided political power. For a long time, it was believed that all power of a government must reside in one person or group of persons located at one place. But these notions changed with the emergence of democracy. In modern democracies, power sharing arrangements can take many forms:</p>

                    <h4>1. Power shared among different organs of government (Horizontal Distribution)</h4>
                    <p>This is often referred to as the .horizontal distribution of power. because it allows different organs of government placed at the same level to exercise different powers. It separates powers into:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Legislature: The body responsible for making laws.</li>
                        <li>Executive: The body responsible for implementing and enforcing laws.</li>
                        <li>Judiciary: The body responsible for interpreting laws and administering justice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="highlight">This arrangement is also known as a .system of checks and balances., as each organ checks the others, ensuring no single entity has unlimited power and maintaining a balance among various institutions.</p>

                    <h4>2. Power shared among governments at different levels (Vertical Distribution)</h4>
                    <p>This is often referred to as the .vertical division of power.. Power is shared among governments at different levels: a general government for the entire country and governments at the provincial or regional level.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Union or Central Government: This is the general government for the entire country (e.g., Union Government in India).</li>
                        <li>State Governments: Governments at the provincial or regional level (e.g., State Governments in India).</li>
                        <li>Local Governments: Below the state level, power may be shared with local governments like municipalities and Panchayats.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This system is called a <span class="highlight">federal division of power</span>, where the Constitution clearly lays down the powers of different levels of government.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="concept-section">
                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h4>3. Power shared among different social groups</h4>
                    <p>Power can also be shared among different social groups, such as religious and linguistic groups. This form of power sharing is common in many countries with diverse populations.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Community Government: As seen in Belgium, this type of government ensures that people of a particular community have a say in matters related to their culture, language, and education.</li>
                        <li>Reserved Constituencies: In some countries, including India, there are reserved constituencies and seats in the legislature and administration for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and other backward classes. This is to give them a fair share in power.</li>
                        <li>This method gives minority communities a fair share in power, preventing the majority from dominating.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>4. Power shared among political parties, pressure groups and movements</h4>
                    <p>In a democracy, power is shared among different political parties, pressure groups, and movements. This happens in several ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Competition among Parties: In a democracy, citizens have the freedom to choose among various contenders for power. This competition ensures that power does not remain in one hand.</li>
                        <li>Coalition Governments: When no single party gets a clear majority in elections, two or more parties form an alliance to form a coalition government. This involves sharing power among themselves.</li>
                        <li>Pressure Groups and Movements: Interest groups (like trade unions, farmers, industrialists) and movements (like environmental movements, women's rights movements) also share power by influencing government decisions. They exert pressure on the rulers to fulfill their demands.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="highlight">This form of power sharing ensures that the diverse views and interests of the society are represented in decision-making.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="next-steps">
                <h3>Summary of Power Sharing</h3>
                <p>Power sharing is crucial for the stability and well-being of a democracy. It not only reduces the potential for conflict but also upholds the very principles of popular rule by ensuring that various sections of society have a voice in governance.</p>
